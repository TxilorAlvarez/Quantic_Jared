# Quantum Tutorials: Mastering Quantum Computing with Azure Quantum

## Welcome to the Quantum Classroom

Embark on a HYPERLINK "a thrilling journey" to master quantum computing with **Quantum Tutorials**, a collection of hands-on Q# programs designed to teach quantum concepts from the ground up. Powered by **Azure Quantum**, this repository offers a progressive learning path, from basic principles like superposition and entanglement to advanced applications like quantum teleportation and algorithms.

This repository is ideal for beginners and intermediate learners eager to explore quantum computing through practical, code-driven tutorials. Each tutorial includes detailed Q# code, explanatory Markdown files, and exercises to deepen your understanding.

## Repository Structure

- **tutorials/**: Q# files and Markdown guides for each topic.
  - `superposition.qs` & `superposition.md`: Create and measure a qubit in superposition.
  - `entanglement.qs` & `entanglement.md`: Create and measure Bell states.
  - `teleportation.qs` & `teleportation.md`: Implement quantum teleportation.
  - *(More tutorials coming soon, e.g., Grover’s algorithm)*.
- **docs/**: Additional resources, such as setup guides and theoretical overviews.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for hybrid workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Azure Quantum Account**: Sign up at [Azure Quantum](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/quantum/).
- **Development Environment**:
  - .NET Core SDK for Q#.
  - Visual Studio Code with the Quantum Development Kit extension.
  - Optional: Python 3.8+ for Qiskit/Cirq compatibility.
- **Dependencies**: Install via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/quantum-tutorials.git
   cd quantum-tutorials
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment (optional):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure Azure Quantum credentials (see [Azure Quantum Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/)).

### Running a Tutorial
Try the superposition tutorial:
```bash
dotnet run --project tutorials/superposition/superposition.csproj
```
Explore the accompanying Markdown files (e.g., `superposition.md`) for detailed explanations.

## Tutorials Overview

1. **Superposition**: Learn to put a qubit in superposition using the Hadamard gate.
2. **Entanglement**: Create and measure entangled Bell states.
3. **Teleportation**: Teleport a quantum state from one qubit to another using entanglement.
4. *(Coming Soon)* Grover’s algorithm, quantum key distribution, and more.
